* Asynchronous execution of IPython source code blocks

This Emacs lisp module adds the possibility of asynchronous execution of IPython source code blocks to ~ob-ipython.el~ which is part of org-mode.

I started out using code for the same purpose fom John Kitchin's [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/scimax-org-babel-ipython.el][scimax]] package. I had a few problems with it, I had different feature requirements, and I wanted to be able to extend this for languages other than IPython in the future. So I ended up analyzing the code and re-composing the bits that I needed, making modifications along the way. So my code is heavily inspired by John's, but not compatible.

The main differences to John's versions are

 - Asynchronous execution is chosen by setting a variable, not by using different commands. This means that all the ~org-babel-execute-...~ perform asynchronous execution.

 - The ~silent~ result option is supported. This is particularly well suited for code blocks that define classes or functions but do not compute anything.

 - The ~async-...~ links have no function, they are just for information.

 - Automatically generated source block names are uuids.

At this time, this is code for personal use, insufficiently tested and even more insufficiently documented. Unsupported as well. If anyone finds it useful nevertheless, go ahead and use it.
